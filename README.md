valorant's vanguard anticheat raises concern over the fact that it runs 24/7 and considering the fact that riot games is owned by tencent. vanguard often compared to rootkits, as it runs so deep in the system that it's hard to keep in check. 

## 💭 what does this do?
this runs in the background and will kill the vanguard process when valorant is not running. your game will still work fine!

## ❓ how do i use this?
simply download the latest release and run.

if you'd like it to run on startup, use the installer file.

to quit, click the tray option and select quit.
